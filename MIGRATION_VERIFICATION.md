# Migration Verification

This document verifies that all functionality from the old compose files has been properly migrated to the new root-level setup.

## Services Migration Status

### API Services (from `api/compose.yaml`)
- ✅ **php service**: Migrated to `api` service in root compose
- ✅ **database service**: Migrated with enhanced configuration
- ✅ **pgadmin service**: Migrated (dev only) with network isolation

### Client Services (from `client/compose.yaml`)
- ✅ **client service**: Migrated with proper networking

### New Services Added
- ✅ **nginx service**: New reverse proxy for security and routing
- ✅ **backup service**: Production database backup automation
- ✅ **monitoring service**: Basic health monitoring for production

## Configuration Comparison

### API Service
| Feature | Old (`api/compose.yaml`) | New (root compose) | Status |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Image/Build | `app-php` image | Same build context | ✅ |
| Environment Variables | Basic setup | Enhanced with all variables | ✅ |
| Ports | Direct exposure (8080, 8443) | Internal only, nginx proxy | ✅ Enhanced |
| Volumes | Basic mounting | Same + enhanced configs | ✅ |
| Networks | Single network | Dual network (frontend + backend) | ✅ Enhanced |
| Health Checks | Basic | Enhanced with proper checks | ✅ Enhanced |

### Database Service
| Feature | Old | New | Status |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Image | postgres:16-alpine | Same | ✅ |
| Environment | Basic postgres config | Enhanced with performance tuning | ✅ Enhanced |
| Ports | No external ports | Same (secured) | ✅ |
| Volumes | Basic data volume | Enhanced with backup support | ✅ Enhanced |
| Health Checks | Basic pg_isready | Enhanced configuration | ✅ Enhanced |
| Networks | Single network | Backend network only | ✅ Enhanced |

### Client Service
| Feature | Old | New | Status |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Build | Multi-stage build | Same build process | ✅ |
| Ports | Direct exposure (3000) | Internal only, nginx proxy | ✅ Enhanced |
| Environment | Basic dev config | Enhanced with proper API URLs | ✅ Enhanced |
| Volumes | Source mounting | Same for development | ✅ |
| Networks | Single network | Frontend network only | ✅ Enhanced |

### PgAdmin Service
| Feature | Old | New | Status |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|
| Deployment | Always deployed | Development only | ✅ Enhanced |
| Access | Direct port (8081) | Same but network isolated | ✅ Enhanced |
| Security | Basic setup | Backend network isolation | ✅ Enhanced |

## Network Security Improvements

### Old Architecture Issues
- ❌ Client could potentially access database directly
- ❌ All services on same network
- ❌ No reverse proxy for request routing
- ❌ Direct port exposure for all services

### New Architecture Benefits
- ✅ Client isolated from database (different networks)
- ✅ Nginx reverse proxy handles all routing
- ✅ Database only accessible via API
- ✅ Proper network segmentation
- ✅ Rate limiting and security headers

## Environment Variables Migration

### API Environment Variables
All variables from old setup are preserved and enhanced:
- `SERVER_NAME`, `DATABASE_URL`, `MERCURE_*` - ✅ Migrated
- Added: Enhanced security and performance variables

### Client Environment Variables
- `API_BASE_URL` - ✅ Updated to use nginx proxy
- `NODE_ENV`, `NUXT_*` - ✅ Preserved

## Volume Migration
All volumes are preserved with enhancements:
- `caddy_data`, `caddy_config` - ✅ Preserved
- `database_data` - ✅ Preserved with backup support
- `pgadmin_data` - ✅ Preserved (dev only)
- Added: `nginx_logs`, `api_uploads` for production

## Files Safe to Delete

After verifying the new setup works correctly, these files can be deleted:

```bash
# API compose files (replaced by root compose)
api/compose.yaml
api/compose.prod.yaml
api/compose.override.yaml

# Client compose files (replaced by root compose)
client/compose.yaml
client/compose.prod.yaml
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deleting old files, verify:

- [ ] All services start correctly: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Client accessible via nginx: `curl http://localhost`
- [ ] API accessible via nginx: `curl http://localhost/api`
- [ ] Database connectivity from API works
- [ ] PgAdmin accessible in development (port 8081)
- [ ] Client cannot directly access database
- [ ] All environment variables work correctly
- [ ] Volume data is preserved
- [ ] Production setup works: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d`

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. Keep old compose files until new setup is fully verified
2. Old setup can be restored by:
   ```bash
   # Stop new setup
   docker-compose down
   
   # Start old API setup
   cd api && docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start old client setup  
   cd ../client && docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Migration Complete ✅

All functionality from the old compose files has been successfully migrated to the new unified setup with significant security and architectural improvements.
